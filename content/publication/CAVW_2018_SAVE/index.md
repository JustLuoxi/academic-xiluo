abstract: Headsets for virtual reality such as head-mounted displays have become ubiquitous  and bring immersive experiences to individual users. People who stand  outside the virtual world may want to share the same scenes that are shown on  the screen of the headset. It is therefore of great importance to merge real and  virtual worlds into the same environment, where physical and virtual objects  exist simultaneously and interact in real time.We propose shared augmented virtual  environment (SAVE), a mixed reality (MR) system that overlays the virtual  world with real objects captured by a Kinect depth camera.We refine the depth  map and exploit a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) based natural image matting  method to obtain the real objects fromcluttered scenes. In the syntheticMR  world, we can render real and virtual objects in real time and handle the depth  from both worlds properly. The advantage of our system is that we connect the  virtual and real worlds with a bridge controllermounted on the Kinect and need  to calibrate the whole systemonly once before use. Our results demonstrate that  the proposed SAVE system is able to create high-quality 1080p live MR footage,  enabling realistic virtual experiences to be shared among a number of people in  potential applications such as education, design, and entertainment.
