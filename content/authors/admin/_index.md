Hi, I am a PhD Candidate at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) and [ShanghaiTech University](http://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/main.htm), China. I am supervised by [Prof. Jingyi Yu](http://vic.shanghaitech.edu.cn/vrvc/en/people/jingyi-yu/), affiliated with [Virtual Reality and Visual Computing Center(VRVC)](http://vic.shanghaitech.edu.cn/vrvc/en/). Prior to that, I was supervised by [Prof. Youyi Zheng](http://youyizheng.net/) for two years, about computer graphics research.
